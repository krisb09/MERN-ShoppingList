# MERN-ShoppingList

Hello fellow developers! This is a simple Shopping List App created with the MERN stack. For the Backend I used MongoDB for the database, MongoDB Compass GUI to interact with it and
Postman to test the endpoints. For the Front End I used React and Axios to connect to the Backend.
